# 🕷️ Xcrap Got Scraping Client

**Xcrap Got Scraping Client** is a package of the Xcrap framework that implements an HTTP client using the [Got Scraping](https://www.npmjs.com/package/got-scraping) library.

## 📦 Installation

There are no secrets to installing it, just use your favorite dependency manager. Here is an example using NPM:

```cmd
npm i @xcrap/got-scraping-client @xcrap/core @xcrap/parser
```

> You need to install `@xcrap/parser` and `@xcrap/core` as well because I left them as `peerDependencies`, which means that the package needs `@xcrap/parser` and `@xcrap/core` as dependencies, however, the ones that the user has installed in the project will be used.

## 🚀 Usage

Like any HTTP client, `GotScrapingClient` has two methods: `fetch()` to make a request for a specific URL and `fetchMany()` to make requests for multiple URLs at the same time, being able to control concurrency and delays between requests. ### Example usage

```ts
import { GotScrapingClient } from "@xcrap/got-scraping-client"
import { extract } from "@xcrap/parser"

;(async() => {
    const client = new GotScrapingClient()
    const url = "https://example.com"
    const response = await client.fetch({ url: url })
    const parser = response.asHtmlParser()
    const pageTitle = await parser.parseFist({ query: "title", extractor: extract("innerText") })

    console.log("Page Title:", pageTitle)
})();
```

### Adding a proxy

In an HTTP client that extends `BaseClient` we can add a proxy in the constructor as we can see in the following example:

1. **Providing a `proxy` string**:

```ts
const client = new GotScrapingClient({ proxy: "http://47.251.122.81:8888" })
```

2. **Providing a function that will generate a `proxy`**:

```ts
function randomProxy() {
    const proxies = [
        "http://47.251.122.81:8888",
        "http://159.203.61.169:3128"
    ]

    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * proxies.length)

    return proxies[randomIndex]
}

const client = new GotScrapingClient({ proxy: randomProxy })
```

### Using a custom User Agent

In a client that extends `BaseClient` we can also customize the `User-Agent` of the requests. We can do this in two ways:

1. **By providing a `userAgent` string:

```ts
const client = new GotScraingClient({ userAgent: "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/134.0.0.0 Safari/537.36" })
```

2. **By providing a function that will generate a `userAgent`**:

```ts
function randomUserAgent() {
    const userAgents = [
        "Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 9_8_4; like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/603.37 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/54.0.1244.188 Mobile Safari/601.5", "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.3;; en-US) AppleWebKit/537.35 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/47.0.1707.185 Safari/601"
    ]

    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * userAgents.length)

    return userAgents[randomIndex]
}

const client = new GotScrapingClient({ userAgent: randomUserAgent })
```

### Using custom Proxy URL

In a client that extends `BaseClient` we can use proxy URLs, I don't know how to explain to you how they work, but I kind of discovered this kind of porxy when I was trying to solve the CORS problem by making a request on the client side, and then I met the *CORS Proxy*. Here I have a [template](https://gist.github.com/marcuth/9fbd321b011da44d1287faae31a8dd3a) for one for CloudFlare Workers in case you want to roll your own.

Well, we can do it the same way we did with `userAgent`:

1. **Providing a `proxyUrl` string**:

```ts
const client = new GotScrapingClient({ proxyUrl: "https://my-proxy-app.my-username.workers.dev" })
```

2. **Providing a function that will generate a `proxyUrl`**:

```ts
function randomProxyUrl() {
    const proxyUrls = [
        "https://my-proxy-app.my-username-1.workers.dev",
        "https://my-proxy-app.my-username-2.workers.dev"
    ]

    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * proxyUrls.length)

    return proxyUrls[randomIndex]
}

const client = new GotScrapingClient({ proxyUrl: randomProxyUrl })
```
